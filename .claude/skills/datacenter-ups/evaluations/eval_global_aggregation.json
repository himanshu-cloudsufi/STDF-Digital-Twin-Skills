    "Shows regional heterogeneity in tipping points: China ~2027, USA ~2028, Europe ~2029, RoW ~2030",
    "Demonstrates that China dominates early Li-ion adoption (cost advantage)",
    "USA and Europe follow with 1-2 year lag (moderate costs)",
    "Rest_of_World has slowest transition (higher financing costs)",
    "Global weighted average tipping point around 2028",
    "By 2040: Global Li-ion share 80-85%, with regional variance 75-92%",
    "Total global demand reaches ~40-50 GWh/year by 2040",
    "China represents ~40% of global demand, USA ~25%, Europe ~20%, RoW ~15%",
