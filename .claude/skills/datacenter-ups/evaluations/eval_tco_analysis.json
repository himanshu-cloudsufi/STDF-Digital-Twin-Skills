    "Step 1: Runs forecast for USA with detailed TCO tracking",
    "Step 2: Calculates VRLA TCO including CapEx (~$220-240/kWh), OpEx ($18/kWh-yr), and replacement costs (5-year life)",
    "Step 3: Calculates Li-ion TCO including declining CapEx (from BESS proxy), OpEx ($6/kWh-yr), and replacement costs (12-year life)",
    "Step 4: Applies 8% discount rate to calculate present value of 15-year TCO",
    "Step 5: Identifies crossover point where Li-ion TCO ≤ VRLA TCO for 3+ consecutive years",
    "Step 6: Analyzes sensitivity to OpEx assumptions (VRLA higher O&M costs)",
    "Uses tco_analysis.py script to generate comparative analysis",
    "Generates output showing annual TCO values for both technologies",
    "Shows TCO components breakdown: CapEx, PV(OpEx), Replacement costs",
    "Identifies tipping point year (expected around 2028 for USA)",
    "Demonstrates that OpEx advantage of Li-ion compensates for higher initial CapEx",
    "Shows Li-ion TCO declining over time while VRLA stays relatively flat",
    "Includes NPV calculations showing 15-year total ownership cost comparison",
    "Output demonstrates that longer Li-ion lifespan (12y vs 5y) reduces replacement frequency",
    "TCO parity occurs before price parity due to operational savings",
    "All TCO values are positive and realistic (not extreme outliers)"
