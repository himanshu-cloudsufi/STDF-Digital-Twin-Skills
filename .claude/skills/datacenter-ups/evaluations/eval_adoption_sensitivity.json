    "Step 1: Runs baseline forecast (8% discount, 12yr lifespan, 95% ceiling)",
    "Step 2: Runs discount rate sensitivity (6% and 10% variants)",
    "Step 3: Runs lifespan sensitivity (10yr and 15yr variants)",
    "Step 4: Runs ceiling sensitivity (90% and 99% variants)",
    "Step 5: Uses adoption_model.py to analyze parameter impacts",
    "Step 6: Generates sensitivity analysis report with parameter sweep results",
    "Discount rate sensitivity: Lower rate (6%) → earlier tipping by ~1-2 years (OpEx savings more valuable)",
    "Discount rate sensitivity: Higher rate (10%) → later tipping by ~1-2 years (upfront costs matter more)",
    "Lifespan sensitivity: Extended life (15yr) → TCO improves by ~15%, tipping advances ~2 years",
    "Lifespan sensitivity: Shorter life (10yr) → TCO worsens, tipping delays ~1-2 years",
    "Ceiling sensitivity: Higher ceiling (99%) → more complete transition, only 1% residual VRLA niche",
    "Ceiling sensitivity: Lower ceiling (90%) → 10% permanent VRLA market (legacy, low-criticality sites)",
    "Shows that tipping point most sensitive to cost trajectories, moderately to lifespan",
    "Final adoption most sensitive to ceiling parameter and lifespan (replacement cycle effects)",
    "Generates tornado chart or parameter sensitivity table",
    "All sensitivity runs maintain mass balance and non-negativity constraints",
    "Demonstrates that parameter uncertainty creates ±3 year range in tipping point estimates",
    "Shows adoption range of 78-92% by 2040 across reasonable parameter bounds"
