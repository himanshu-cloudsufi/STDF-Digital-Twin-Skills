    "Step 1: Runs forecast for Europe baseline scenario",

    "Step 4: Uses compare_scenarios.py to generate comparative analysis",
    "Generates comparison report showing differential analysis vs baseline",
    "Report includes absolute differences (kt) and percentage differences for each scenario vs baseline",
    "Shows that accelerated_ev scenario results in lower lead demand (due to more EVs with smaller batteries)",
    "Shows that extended_lifecycles scenario results in lower replacement demand (longer battery life)",
    "Creates comparative visualization plots in output/plots directory",
    "Comparison includes growth rate analysis across scenarios",
    "Output demonstrates understanding that different scenarios have directional impacts (EV adoption reduces demand, extended lifecycles reduce replacement frequency)",
    "Successfully handles multiple CSV inputs from the three forecast runs"
